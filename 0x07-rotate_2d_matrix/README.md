For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.


Steps to Rotate a 2D Matrix Clockwise by 90 Degrees
Transpose the Matrix:
Transposition involves swapping the rows and columns of the matrix. In other words, the element at position (i, j) will move to (j, i).
Reverse Each Row:
After transposing, each row of the matrix is reversed to achieve the 90-degree rotation.
Implementation Details
In-place Operation:
The solution should modify the input matrix without using extra space for another matrix.
Matrix Representation:
The matrix is represented as a list of lists in Python.
