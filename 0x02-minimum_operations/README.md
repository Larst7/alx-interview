# Minimum Operations

## Description

This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. Starting from a single character 'H', you can either "Copy All" the current text or "Paste" what has been copied. The goal is to determine the minimum number of such operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters.

## Concepts and Resources
